# API standard

How Marc's apps let other things read and drive them: Docket's briefs, Vital Signs screens, the ESP32 panels, the widget display, Home Assistant, n8n and TRMNL. `APP-STANDARD.md` says how an app is built; this says what its outside API looks like, so a reader written once works against every app.

**Status:** draft 3, 6 Nov 2026, released with the shared code (section 12) in v1.10. Decisions taken with Marc on 5 Nov 2026 are marked **(decided)**. Binge Stats built all of it first, as the pilot (decided), and is running it; draft 3 takes in what the build found (section 17). The shared code was lifted out of Binge (sections 12 and 14).

## 1. What it's for

| Reader | Where it runs | What it needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Docket briefs** (Claude, via Docket's `feed_fetch`) | Docket's server, on the LAN | Feeds and status, read-only. The token stays in Docket; Claude never sees it. |
| **Vital Signs** pages | Its server's data proxy, then Chromium on the Pis | Status, feeds, images, display pages; live updates for alerts. |
| **ESP32 panels** (through the PC panel agent) | The PC | Small JSON: short labels, numbers, pre-formatted times. Actions for buttons. |
| **Home Assistant** | LAN | Status as REST sensors, actions as REST commands, webhooks for automations. |
| **TRMNL** and other cloud displays | TRMNL's cloud, polling over the internet | Small JSON with the token in the URL. Only for apps Marc puts on the tunnel. |
| **The widget display** and any kiosk | A browser on the LAN | Display pages that just need a URL. |

What it isn't: a replacement for an app's own page JSON. Each app keeps its private `/api/...` routes for its own UI, with the session cookie and CSRF (`APP-STANDARD.md` 4). The public contract lives only under **`/api/v1/`**, plus `/display/` and `/healthz`.

**Apps that already have a `/api/v1/`** (Binge Stats) keep every existing route exactly as it is (path, shape and error shape), because live readers depend on them. The standard's routes are added beside them. The old routes do pick up the shared token handling (URL tokens, lockout, ETags, rate limit), since none of that changes their bodies.

## 2. The shape of it

Every app that adopts the standard has these. Anything an app doesn't have is simply missing from `meta`, not an error.

| Path | Method | Token | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/healthz` | GET | none | Unchanged from `APP-STANDARD.md`: `{"ok": true, "busy": [...]}`. Says nothing about contents. |
| `/api/v1/meta` | GET | read | Who the app is and what it offers: version, accent, icon, and the list of feeds, actions, displays and events. Readers use it to build pickers. |
| `/api/v1/status` | GET | read | The one-glance summary: a state, a headline and a few numbers. Every display and HA sensor starts here. |
| `/api/v1/feeds/<name>` | GET | read | A list of items in the common item shape (section 5). |
| `/api/v1/images/<kind>/<id>` | GET | read | Artwork or a thumbnail, resized by the app. |
| `/api/v1/actions/<name>` | POST | write | One named thing to do, with a JSON body. |
| `/api/v1/events` | GET | read | Server-sent events: live changes for screens. |
| `/display/<name>` | GET | read | A ready-made HTML card in the app's look, for kiosks and the widget display. |

Readers send `Accept: application/json` (except for images, events and display pages). Every JSON answer is UTF-8, `snake_case`, and is an object at the top level, never a bare list, so a field can be added later without breaking anyone.

## 3. Tokens

- **Made in the app's Settings,** on an **API tokens** card (a shared partial in this repo), with a name ("Vital Signs desk", "TRMNL kitchen") and a scope: **read** or **write**. A write token can also read.
- **Shown once,** stored only as a SHA-256 hash, with `created_at` and `last_used_at` shown on the card. Revoke is one click. This is how Binge Stats already does it; it's the model.
- **Sent as** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **Read tokens may also go in the URL** as `?token=…` **(decided)**, because TRMNL's cloud polling and simple firmware can't always set a header. Write tokens are refused in the URL with `400 {"error": "Write tokens go in the Authorization header, never the URL."}`. URLs end up in logs, so a URL token should be a display's own read token, easy to revoke.
- **Tokens never reach a log.** gunicorn's default access log has the query string (`%(r)s`, `%(q)s`) and the referrer (`%(f)s`), so every app sets `--access-logformat '%(h)s %(t)s "%(m)s %(U)s %(H)s" %(s)s %(b)s "%(a)s"'` (`APP-STANDARD.md` 3): the path without the query string, and no referrer. The app's own logging never prints `request.url` or `request.full_path` for these paths, and `/display/` pages send `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.
- **A signed-in admin** (the app's own session cookie) can read every `/api/v1/` GET too, so the app's own pages and its `/display/` previews work without a token. In an app with viewer or other non-admin logins (Binge Stats), only an admin session counts; any other session is treated as no session. Writes from a session still need CSRF.
- **Bad tokens:** `401 {"error": "That token isn't valid. Make a new one in Settings → API tokens."}`. Ten bad tokens from one address in a minute lock that address out for 15 minutes with `429` and `Retry-After`, the same rule as Docket's MCP. The address is `CF-Connecting-IP` when it's there, else the client IP: an app with no trusted proxies sees every tunnel request coming from cloudflared, so keyed by that, one stranger's bad tokens would lock out every tunnel reader. Cloudflare overwrites the header, so it can't be faked from outside, and faking it on the LAN only dodges the lockout. A good token with the wrong scope gets `403`.
- **Secrets an app holds for others** (Plex tokens, indexer keys, a mail password) never appear in any `/api/v1/` answer, image URL or display page.

## 4. Exposure

- **LAN by default (decided).** `/api/v1/`, `/display/` and `/healthz` answer on the app's LAN address.
- **Through the tunnel only per app, by Marc's choice (decided).** If an app's hostname is on the Cloudflare tunnel, its `/api/v1/` works there too, always with a token. An app can switch that off with `API_PUBLIC=0` in its env, which makes it refuse `/api/v1/` and `/display/` requests that came through the proxy (`CF-Connecting-IP` present) with `403`.
- **No CORS by default.** Browser readers on another origin go through a server (Vital Signs' data proxy). An app may list allowed origins in Settings if one is ever needed.

## 5. Common shapes

### Status

```json
{
  "app": "encore",
  "state": "ok",
  "headline": "2 albums downloading",
  "detail": "Next: Rumours (1977), 64%",
  "counts": [
    {"key": "downloading", "label": "Downloading", "value": 2},
    {"key": "queued", "label": "Queued", "value": 5},
    {"key": "failed_today", "label": "Failed today", "value": 0, "tone": "danger"}
  ],
  "url": "https://encore.marctew.co.uk/",
  "generated_at": "2026-11-05T22:40:00Z",
  "refresh_s": 30
}
```

- `state` is one of `ok`, `busy`, `warning`, `error`, `off`. It maps straight to the design's tones (success, info, warning, danger, muted) so every screen colours it the same.
- `headline` is one short sentence that makes sense on its own on a 2-inch screen. `detail` is optional and can be longer.
- `counts` is at most 6 entries. `key` is stable for machines (HA sensors read `counts[key=...]`), `label` is for people. `tone` is optional.
- `refresh_s` is how often a poller should come back. Readers that can't do events use it.

### Feeds and items

```json
{
  "feed": "arrivals",
  "title": "Just arrived",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "plex:58213",
      "title": "Slow Horses",
      "subtitle": "S5 E3 · Missing Persons",
      "at": "2026-11-05T19:12:00Z",
      "at_label": "Today 19:12",
      "tone": "accent",
      "image": "/api/v1/images/poster/58213",
      "url": "http://192.168.4.57:8181/shows/412",
      "meta": {"show_id": 412, "season": 5, "episode": 3}
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": null,
  "generated_at": "2026-11-05T22:40:00Z",
  "refresh_s": 300
}
```

- Every item has `id` (stable, unique within the feed) and `title`. Everything else is optional, but when a field fits one of these names it uses it.
- `at` is UTC ISO 8601 ending in `Z`. `at_label` is the same moment already written for a person in the app's time zone ("Today 19:12", "Sat 7 Nov", "in 2 h"), because an ESP32 or a Liquid template shouldn't have to do time zones.
- `image` is a path on the same app (section 6), never a third-party URL that carries a token.
- `url` opens the thing in the app, for a tap on a screen or a link in a brief.
- `meta` holds the feed's own fields. It's documented per feed and is where app-specific detail goes, so the top level stays the same for everyone.
- **Query parameters** every feed accepts: `limit` (default 20, at most 100), `since` (ISO time: items with `at` after it), `cursor` (from `next_cursor`). A feed may add its own, listed in `meta`.

### Errors

```json
{"error": "There's no feed called 'arivals'.", "code": "not_found"}
```

This shape is for the standard's routes. An app's older `/api/v1/` routes keep the error shape they already had (section 1). `error` is a sentence for a person (`APP-STANDARD.md` 4). `code` is for machines: `bad_request`, `unauthorised`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, `rate_limited`, `busy`, `upstream` (the app couldn't reach Plex, SABnzbd...), `error`. `429` and `503` always carry `Retry-After`.

### Meta

```json
{
  "app": "binge-stats",
  "name": "Binge Stats",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "sha": "ba66f41",
  "api": 1,
  "accent": "violet",
  "icon": "/static/icons/icon-192.png",
  "time_zone": "Europe/London",
  "feeds": [{"name": "arrivals", "title": "Just arrived", "refresh_s": 300, "params": {"kind": "movie | show"}}],
  "actions": [{"name": "mark_watched", "title": "Mark watched", "body": {"item_id": "int"}}],
  "displays": [{"name": "now-playing", "title": "Now playing", "sizes": ["320x240", "800x480", "1920x1080"]}],
  "events": ["arrival", "playback.start", "playback.stop"]
}
```

## 6. Images

- `GET /api/v1/images/<kind>/<id>?w=320` (or `h=`). The app fetches the original with its own credentials, resizes it, and answers `image/webp` (or `image/jpeg` if the reader's `Accept` doesn't list WebP, for ESP32 decoders).
- Widths snap to 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1280, so caches stay small. Resized images are cached on disk in `/var/cache/<app>/images/` (`APP-STANDARD.md` 3), or under the app's data volume for an app in Docker (Binge Stats: `/data/image-cache/`). Each file is named by a hash of kind, id, width, format, quality and grey. They're served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400` and an ETag, and pruned oldest-first (by mtime) above 500 MB by a background job.
- `?fmt=jpeg&q=70` is allowed for devices that need it. `?gray=1` gives greyscale for e-ink.
- An image path in a feed works with the same token the feed was read with, so a display can load it straight away.

## 7. Actions

- `POST /api/v1/actions/<name>` with a JSON body. Write token only, in the header.
- **`Idempotency-Key`** header (any string up to 100 characters): repeating a request with the same key within 24 hours gives the first answer again and does nothing twice. Panels and HA retry, so this matters.
- Answer: `{"ok": true, "message": "Queued Rumours (1977).", "result": {...}}`. `message` is short enough for a toast or a panel's status line.
- Only actions listed in `meta` exist. They're named for what they do (`add_task`, `queue_album`, `mark_watched`, `skip_track`), not generic `update` endpoints, and each is documented with its body.
- Anything destructive in the app's own UI (delete, restore) isn't offered as an action unless Marc asks for that one specifically.
- Every action that runs, refused or not, is logged in the app's action log with the token's name, so "who did that" always has an answer. A repeat answered from an `Idempotency-Key` isn't logged again, since nothing ran. An upstream failure (`502`) isn't remembered against its key, so it can be retried with the same one.
- An admin signed in to the app can call actions from its own pages with the session cookie and `X-CSRF-Token`; the log names them as "Admin session".

## 8. Live updates (decided: push from the start)

### Events stream

- `GET /api/v1/events` is **server-sent events** (`text/event-stream`). Read token (URL or header).
- Each event: `event: <type>`, `id: <row id>`, `data: {"type": "...", "at": "...Z", "title": "...", "item": {...item shape...}}`. Types are dotted and listed in `meta` (`arrival`, `download.finished`, `task.due`, `watch.fired`).
- **Events go through SQLite, not memory.** Apps can have more than one gunicorn worker, and a separate worker process where events actually start (Binge Stats has both). So `publish()` writes a row to a small table, from whichever process sees the event, and each open stream reads new rows from it:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE events (
    id    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,   -- the SSE id and Last-Event-ID
    type  TEXT NOT NULL,         -- dotted, e.g. playback.start
    at    TEXT NOT NULL,         -- UTC ...Z (an app that stores epoch seconds may store those, and convert at the edge)
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    item  TEXT NOT NULL          -- JSON, the item shape
  );
  CREATE INDEX events_at ON events (at);
  ```

- A stream checks for new rows once a second, with a read-only query on its own connection, and sends `: ping` every 25 seconds so proxies don't close it.
- Reconnecting with `Last-Event-ID` (the header, or `?last_event_id=`) replays up to 200 rows after that id. Without one, nothing is replayed. A background job prunes rows older than an hour but always keeps the last 200.
- **Capacity:** at most **8 open streams per app, split across its gunicorn workers** (one worker: 8; two workers: 4 each). Beyond that, `503` with `Retry-After: 30`. Each stream holds a thread, so an app that adopts events raises `--threads` to leave at least 8 free for everything else.
- On `SIGTERM` the stream ends, so `scripts/update.sh` restarts don't hang.
- Through Cloudflare, streams work but are closed after about 100 seconds without data; the 25-second ping prevents that.

### Webhooks out

For Home Assistant and n8n, which handle incoming webhooks better than streams:

- Settings → **Webhooks**: a URL, the event types to send, and a secret.
- Docket-style delivery, always from a background job, never inside a request: each event makes one delivery per matching webhook, POSTed as JSON (the same `data` as the stream) with `X-Signature: sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body with the secret>` and a 10-second timeout. A failure is retried after 1, 3 and 6 minutes, then given up, with the last success and last error shown on the webhook's row in Settings.
- Home Assistant's own webhook trigger (`/api/webhook/<id>`) is the expected target. Its id is the secret there, so the URL is stored like a password and never shown again in full.

### Push to Marc's phone

Unchanged: apps that need to tell Marc something use the self-hosted ntfy server, each with its own write-only token. Events and webhooks are for machines and screens; ntfy is for Marc.

## 9. Display pages

- `GET /display/<name>` returns a full HTML page in the app's look (DESIGN-SPEC tokens, its accent), sized to fill the viewport, with no sidebar, no login prompt and no scroll bars.
- Parameters: `token` (read), `theme=dark|light` (default dark), `size=800x480` (a hint for layout breakpoints; the page still fills whatever it's given), `scale=1.5` for far-away screens, `static=1` to render once with no JavaScript (e-ink and screenshot services), and `accent=` to override the app's accent so a wall of screens can match.
- Unless `static=1`, the page reloads **its own body** (the same route with `fragment=1`) every `refresh_s`, and straight away when a relevant event comes in on `/api/v1/events`. One server-side template renders both the page and its updates, so there's no second renderer in JavaScript to keep in step. If the app is down it keeps the last content and shows a small "Last updated 14:02" in faint text, instead of an error page.
- Errors (no token, a bad one, a write token in the URL) are a **plain HTML page** with the reason, not JSON: whatever shows a display page is a screen with nobody to read JSON. A signed-in admin can open the page without a token, to preview it.
- A display page sends `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `Cache-Control: no-store` and `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`, since its token is in its own URLs.
- The shell is `templates/display/base.html` (section 12): plain CSS and design tokens, so it works with `uniform.css` and with the Tailwind entry. The app's template extends it and fills `body`.
- The same data as the JSON, so anything a display page shows is also reachable as JSON for screens that render their own (TRMNL's Liquid, the ESP32s).
- Vital Signs can show any display page as a normal web page, and can list them from `meta` to offer them as content.

## 10. Caching and politeness

- Every GET answers with an `ETag`. A reader sending `If-None-Match` gets `304` with no body. Polling every 30 seconds then costs almost nothing.
- `Cache-Control: private, max-age=<refresh_s / 2>` on status and feeds.
- Answers aim to be small: status under 2 KB, a feed page under 50 KB. The ESP32s parse JSON in a few hundred KB of RAM.
- An app that's busy (an import) still answers status quickly from what it has, with `state: "busy"`, rather than blocking.
- Per-token limit: 120 requests a minute, then `429` with `Retry-After`. Images and events don't count towards it.
- The rate limit and the bad-token lockout live in memory, per gunicorn worker. With two workers they're about twice as loose. That's accepted, since tokens are 256-bit, and an app says so in its `docs/API.md` rather than adding shared state.

## 11. Versioning

- `api: 1` in `meta`. Within v1, changes are **additive only**: new feeds, new fields, new actions, new event types. Readers ignore fields they don't know.
- A breaking change means `/api/v2/` alongside v1 for at least a month, with v1 marked `"deprecated": "2027-01-01"` in `meta`.
- Each app documents its endpoints in `docs/API.md`: every feed with its `meta` fields, every action with its body, every event type, and every display. That file is what Claude reads before writing a reader.

## 12. Shared code

Lifted from Binge Stats' pilot (decided) and released in v1.10. An app takes these through the design updater, like `du_flask.py`, and never edits them in place.

**`tools/du_api.py`**, a Flask module that imports nothing from any app:

- `init_api(app, *, name, title, version, sha, accent, icon, time_zone, check_token, is_admin_session, csrf_ok, legacy_error=None, max_streams=8)` installs the gate on every request under `/api/v1/` and `/display/`: who's asking (Bearer, `?token=` for read tokens, or the admin session), the URL-token rule, the lockout and rate limit, `API_PUBLIC`, and weak ETags with `304`. It returns the core (also `app.extensions["du_api"]`). `check_token(token)` returns `{id, name, scope}` or `None`; `sha`, `time_zone`, `is_admin_session` and `csrf_ok` are callables. An app that already had `/api/v1` routes passes `legacy_error(code, message, status)` so refusals on those keep their old shape.
- The registry behind `meta`: `core.add_feed(name, title, refresh_s, params)`, `add_action(name, title, body, when=None)` (`when` hides an action that's switched off), `add_display(name, title, sizes)` and `add_events(types)`; `core.meta()` builds the answer. `core.open_endpoints` (no token, e.g. a health check) and `core.unmetered_endpoints` (images and events) are sets of endpoint names.
- `@standard("read" | "write")` on each of the standard's routes: scope check, CSRF for a session's writes, the standard's error shape. `identity()` says who's asking, for older routes and for the action log. `ApiCore.error(code, message, status)` builds an error; `cached(resp, refresh_s)` sets `Cache-Control`.
- `@display` on each display page: read access, the HTML error page, and the no-referrer, no-store headers.
- `image_response(cache_dir, kind, ident, fetch)`: `fetch(box)` returns the original bytes, fetched with the app's own credentials, at least `box` wide; the module snaps the width, resizes with Pillow, picks WebP or JPEG, honours `fmt`, `q` and `gray`, caches on disk and sends an ETag. `prune_image_cache(dir)` for the app's background job.
- `event_stream(rows_after, last_id, stopping=core.stopping)`, `StreamSlots` (`core.streams.take()` gives a release function or `None` when full) and `stop_streams_on_sigterm(core)`, for `/api/v1/events`. `rows_after(id)` reads the app's own `events` table (section 8).
- `sign(body, secret)`, `verify(body, secret, header)` and `RETRY_AFTER_S`, for webhooks. Each app keeps its own `webhooks` and `webhook_deliveries` tables and sends from its background worker.
- `iso(ts)` and `parse_iso(s)` for the standard's UTC times.

Pillow is the one new dependency (images only).

**Templates:**
- `templates/display/base.html`: the display page shell (section 9).
- `templates/partials/api_tokens_card.html`: tokens (made, listed, revoked), previews of the app's display pages, and the latest API actions. `templates/partials/webhooks_card.html`: webhooks with their last success or error, the signing secret shown once, and the event-type filter. Both go in Settings after the app's own settings, before the Design system card; each documents the variables it needs at its top. Revoke, New secret and Delete use `js/confirm.js` (DESIGN-SPEC 7.10) when the page loads it.

**`tools/check_api.py <base_url> <read_token> [write_token]`** checks a running app against this standard: `meta` and `status` shapes, every feed's item shape, ETag and `304`, a read token in the URL, a bad token, a write token in the URL refused, images in WebP and JPEG, the events stream, and each display page with and without a token. Read-only and standard library only, so it runs on the app's host. Run it after each app's change, like `check_du_sync.py`.

**In an app's updater config** (DESIGN-SPEC 18.1), the lines for these, with the app's own paths:

```toml
"tools/du_api.py" = "<package>/du_api.py"
"templates/display/base.html" = "<package>/templates/display/base.html"
"templates/partials/api_tokens_card.html" = "<package>/templates/partials/api_tokens_card.html"
"templates/partials/webhooks_card.html" = "<package>/templates/partials/webhooks_card.html"
"tools/check_api.py" = "scripts/check_api.py"
"API-STANDARD.md" = "docs/design/API-STANDARD.md"
```

## 13. Readers

How each reader uses it, once apps have it:

- **Docket:** Settings → **App feeds** holds each app's base URL and a read token (stored like the mail settings, out of the database and backups). A new MCP tool `feed_fetch(app, feed, limit?, since?)` and `app_status(app)` read them server-side, so briefs stop needing claude-ops recipes and Claude never handles a token. This is build step 8.
- **Vital Signs:** a source type `du_app` (base URL and token in `server.toml`) that the data proxy understands, plus "Display page" as content, picked from the app's `meta`.
- **PC panel agent:** reads `status` and feeds with a read token (already does, against Binge's v1), and calls actions for the panel buttons with a separate write token.
- **Home Assistant:** a `rest` sensor per app on `/api/v1/status` (`value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"`, `json_attributes: [headline, counts]`), `rest_command`s for actions, and webhook triggers for events.
- **TRMNL:** a private plugin polling `https://<app>.marctew.co.uk/api/v1/status?token=…` (and a feed if needed), with a Liquid template. Only for apps on the tunnel.

## 14. Rolling it out

One app at a time, like the design system. **Binge Stats goes first, as the pilot (decided 5 Nov 2026):** the shared code comes out of it rather than going into it.

1. **Done, 5–6 Nov 2026: Binge Stats built the standard in-app,** to its own plan (`docs/specs/api-standard.md` in its repo), in six stages: the shared core with `meta` and `status`, then feeds and images, actions, events and webhooks, the `now-playing` display page, and docs with checking. Its current endpoints stayed exactly as they were (section 1). What was checked against the live server, including a 5½-minute events stream through the Cloudflare tunnel, is in its `docs/verification.md`.
2. **Done in v1.10: the shared code lifted** into this repo (`du_api.py`, the API tokens and webhooks cards, the display shell, `check_api.py`), with what the pilot found written in (section 17). Binge takes the shared copies through the design updater.
3. **Docket:** `status` (due today, overdue, the night shift), feeds (`today`, `upcoming`, `reports`), actions (`add_task`, `complete_task`), events (`task.due`, `brief.published`, `watch.fired`, `approval.requested`). Then its reader side (section 13), which is step 8.
4. **Encore** (downloads), **PodBridge** (new episodes, sync state), **Vital Signs** (its own status), **The Back Room** (status only, LAN only, unless Marc wants more).
5. claude-ops is deployed only by Marc and keeps its own API; it isn't part of this unless he says so.

## 15. Open questions

1. **TRMNL:** does Marc have a TRMNL device to target, or is it only the builder for other people? It changes whether display pages need an 800x480 one-bit mode (`static=1&gray=1`) first.
2. **Which display pages first?** Likely candidates: Binge "now playing", Docket "today", Encore "downloads".
3. **HA discovery:** should apps also offer an MQTT discovery option (Stagehand already talks MQTT to HA), or is REST plus webhooks enough?

## 16. Changes in draft 2

From Binge Stats' pilot plan (5 Nov 2026), all accepted:

1. **Events through SQLite** with the row id as `Last-Event-ID`, not an in-memory ring. This works with more than one gunicorn worker and with a separate worker process. The stream cap is 8 per app, split across workers. (Section 8.)
2. **Existing `/api/v1/` routes keep their error shape.** Only the standard's routes must use `{"error", "code"}`. (Sections 1 and 5.)
3. **Only an admin session** reads `/api/v1/` without a token, in apps with viewer or non-admin logins. (Section 3.)
4. **The access-log format** that keeps tokens out of logs, and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on display pages. (Section 3, and `APP-STANDARD.md` 3.)
5. **Image cache path** under `/var/cache/<app>/` (matching `APP-STANDARD.md`), or the data volume for Docker apps. (Section 6.)
6. **In-memory limits per worker are accepted** and documented, with no shared state. (Section 10.)

Also: Binge is the pilot and the shared code is lifted from it (sections 12 and 14), and webhook delivery always runs in a background job, with a retry schedule of 1, 3 and 6 minutes (section 8).

## 17. Changes in draft 3

From building and running the pilot in Binge Stats (6 Nov 2026):

1. **The lockout is keyed by `CF-Connecting-IP`** when it's there, so one stranger can't lock out every reader coming through the tunnel. (Section 3.)
2. **A repeat answered from an `Idempotency-Key` isn't logged again**, and a `502` isn't remembered against its key. An admin session can call actions too, with CSRF. (Section 7.)
3. **Display pages reload their own body** (`fragment=1`) rather than re-rendering JSON in the browser, **refuse with a plain HTML page**, and send no-referrer and no-store. (Section 9.)
4. **Section 12 now describes the shared code as built**: `init_api` with callables and an optional `legacy_error`, `@standard` and `@display` rather than per-feed decorators, `image_response`, `event_stream` with `StreamSlots`, and `sign`. Each app keeps its own events and webhook tables. The updater config lines are listed.
5. **Docs:** the tokens and webhooks cards say what they need; `tools/check_api.py` also checks images, the events stream and display pages.
